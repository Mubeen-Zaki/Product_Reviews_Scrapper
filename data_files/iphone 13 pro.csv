iphone 13 pro,Flipkart Customer,5,Excellent,"In love with the phone. The night pictures and videos  that come out of the phone are too good. Upgraded from 12 mini. Not a huge difference in camera but night pictures are definitely an upgrade. The battery life is exceptional. Often use it as hotspot for around  6 hrs and after more than 10 hours, battery is more than 60% if other apps are not heavily used. 120hz feels super smooth. Cons: Price is still very high"
